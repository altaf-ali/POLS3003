<h4 class="heading">About this course</h4>




<p class="p">Data Science and Big Data
Analytics are exciting new areas that combine scientific inquiry, substantive
expertise, programming, and statistical knowledge. One of the main challenges
for businesses and policy makers when using big data is to find people with the
appropriate skills. Data Science is no longer only the domain of computer scientists
and engineers. Good Data Science requires experts that combine substantive
knowledge with data analytical skills, which makes it a prime area for social
scientists with an interest in quantitative methods. <br /></p>

of this course. The course integrates prior training in quantitative methods
(statistics) and coding with substantive expertise and introduces the
fundamental concepts and techniques of Data Science and Big Data Analytics. </p>

<p class="p"><strong>Aims</strong></p>
<p class="p">This
course aims to provide an introduction to the data science approach to the
quantitative analysis of data using the methods of statistical learning, an
approach blending classical statistical methods with recent advances in computational
and machine learning. The course will cover the main analytical methods from
this field with hands-on applications using example datasets, so that students
gain experience with and confidence in using the methods we cover. It also
covers data preparation and processing, including working with structured
databases, key-value formatted data (JSON), and unstructured textual data.</p>
<p class="p"><strong>Learning outcomes</strong></p>
<p class="p">At
the end of this course students will have a sound understanding of the field of
data science, the ability to analyse data using some of its main methods, and a
solid foundation for more advanced or more specialized study.</p>
<p class="p"><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p class="p">This is an advanced course
intended for students who’ve already had some training in quantitative methods
for data analysis. The minimum prerequisite is a good knowledge of linear
regression models and familiarity with a statistical software package (e.g., R,
Stata, SPSS, SAS, MATLAB). </p>
<p class="p">In order to take the course
students must have passed ECON2007 (Quantitative Economics and Econometrics).
If you don’t have the required prerequisites or you believe you have taken an
equivalent course please contact the course tutor for confirmation. </p>
